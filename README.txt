Readability - 
What pieces of code help versus obscure your understanding of the algorithm?
	The read data method helped my understanding, while 
	the the algorithm for sorting the bins obscured my understanding.
What comments might be helpful within the code?
	Comments that explained and separated related chucks, such as printing the output,
	or manipulating the queue.
Are there places where the code could be more concise and also more clear?
	The main method was unnecessary long and unclear
Testability
How would you test this code for bugs?
	Running specific text files with known correct outputs, and comparing it to our programs
	output.
Give a specific example of a "test case" as the code is currently written.
	Using the text file "example.txt" and the program's output
What additional functions may be helpful?
	
Give a specific example of a "test case" for your new function.
Extensibility

What Code Smells can you find?
	The main function 
What suggestions does this code make about how someone would extend it in the future to compare the performance of a wider variety of fitting algorithms?
What dependencies are there between different parts of the code?
How easy to find are those dependencies?
Can you clarify or remove those dependencies?
